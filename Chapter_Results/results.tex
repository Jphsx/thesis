\section{Asymptotic Limits}

This search is designed to be generically sensitive to SUSY with an emphasis on compressed scenarios. The consequence is sensitivity to a wide variety of models and final states, so we present expected upper limits on the cross sections for stop, electroweakino, and slepton processes. The results use the full Run II SM MC background combined with the data driven fit model described in the previous chapter. The limits are calculated using the asymptotic method for profile-likelihood test statistic \cite{Cowan:2010js}.

\section{Model Dependent Interpretation}
The TChiWZ limits from the previous section use a simplified model which is described in Chapter 1. The decay kinematics in this simplified model  use a flat matrix element resulting in $W$ and $Z$ boson 3 body uniform phase space decays. However, the 3 body decay phase space depends on the sign of the eigenstates of the neutralino mass matrix. A reweighting of events in the simplified TChiWZ model is performed to assess the difference in kinematics of the Z decay. This model reinterpretation has been done by other analyses in ATLAS and CMS \cite{CMS:2021edw}\cite{ATLAS:2019lng}, but are restricted to $Z(\rightarrow \ell\ell)$. We extend the reweighting strategy to the more general case of di-fermion pairs where neutralino A undergoes a three body decay to a di fermion pair and neutralino B. 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:3bd}
A \rightarrow f \bar{f} B
\end{equation}
The expression for the matrix element of the process in Equation \ref{eq:3bd} uses a phase space parameterization $x,y,z$ according to \cite{Nojiri:1999ki} which can be used to express the partial width 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dgam}
\frac{d^2\Gamma^\pm}{dxdy}\sim \frac{(1-x)(x-r_B^2)+(1-y)(y-r_B^2)\pm 2|r_B|z}{(z-r_z^2)^2}
\end{equation}
$x,y,z$ are represented by mass ratios
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
x=(m_{\bar{f}B}/m_A)^2 \\
y=(m_{fB}/m_A)^2 \\
z=(m_{f\bar{f}}/m_A)^2 
\end{split}
\end{equation} 
and the $r$ parameters represent mass ratios of particle B or Z mass with particle A
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
r_B = m_B/m_A \\
r_Z = m_Z/m_A 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
By sampling the $x,y,z$ space from Equation \ref{eq:dgam} along the allowed boundaries:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
r_B^2 \leq x \leq 1 \\
r_B^2 \leq x \leq 1 \\
z(xy-r_B^2) \geq 0
\end{split}
\end{equation}
we can generate the four momentum of all particles in the 3 body decay according to the two eigenstate cases, OS ($\Gamma^-$) and SS ($\Gamma^+$). Using the model dependent $(x,z)$ distribution a weight can be calculated mapping the original phase space of the simplified model to the OS or SS case. The  Dalitz distributions, which fully describe the differences in Z decays in terms of $x$ and $z$ are shown in Figure \ref{fig:dalitzplot} for a TChiWZ grid point with $m_A = 300$ GeV and $m_B= 270$ GeV.

The heatmap compares the uniform phase space simplified model against the model dependent scenarios OS and SS which distribute the four momenta of the decay components differently. }{fig:dalitzplot}

The relative differences in the final state kinematics for each model is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rwt} which uses the same TChiWZ grid point.

The resulting limits for the  model dependent cases are shown in Figure \ref{fig:rwtlim}. The exclusion boundary, between the two model dependent cases, are similar but the OS scenario is able to exclude higher masses likely due to the momentum enhancement of $A$ (LSP) which produces a larger missing momentum signature as seen on the red curve in Figure \ref{fig:rwt} right.
