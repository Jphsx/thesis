\chapter{The Standard Model and Supersymmetry}

\begin{chapterabstract}
Here we outline the fundamental concepts of particle physics, we introduce the set of fundamental particles, fields, and interactions which are described by the standard model. Since the standard model does not solve all of the problems of particle physics I introduce supersymmetry, a well motivated extension to the standard model. The motivation for the SUSY extension is reserved for the following chapter.

\section{The Standard Model}

The Standard Model(SM) is a collection of adhoc theories used to predict and reproduce experimental data. The theory itself incorporates four major concepts: Quantum Field theory, the Dirac equation, the gauge principle, and the higgs mechanism. These four principles are constrained by physical data and describe the set of elementary particles, known as fermions and bosons. The SM generally refers to the SM Lagrangian, an equation with different sectors that describe different subsets of particles, fields, and their interactions. The SM Lagrangian itself consists of 26 free parameters which are input by hand. These parameters are: the masses of the 12 fermions, 3 coupling constants that describe gauge interactions: $g, g', g_s$; 2 parameters to desribe the Higgs potential $\mu, \lambda$ which are the higgs mass $m_h$ and the vacuum expectation value (vev), and 9 mixing angles which describe the  PMNS and CKM matrices i.e. the mixing of different fermionic fields. The 12 fermion paramters are subdivided by three neutrinos $m_\nu^i$, three charged leptons $m_\ell^\pm$, and six quarks $m_q$; 

Quantum field theory (QFT) provides a descriptions for both known and theoretical particles by combining quantum theory, the field concept, and relativity (cite peskin?). The gauge theory aspect describes the exact nature of QFT interactions and provides the mechanisms for the electromagnetic, strong, weak forces.  We know of four gauge fields:  $\vec{G}$ which transforms under $SU(3)$ and governs strong interactions, $\vec{W}$ and $B$ which transform under $SU(2)_L \times U(1)$ and governs electromagnetic and weak interactions. The combination of the gauge fields and fermion fields along with the Dirac equation yields eigenstates that represent fermionic matter particles. In general these particles would be massless if not for the inclusion of the complex scalar Higgs field.  The spontaneous symmetry breaking of the Higgs field, due to the Yukawa coupling, creates a non zero vev which is responsible for generating the masses of the electroweak gauge bosons. Additionally, the interaction between the fermionic fields and the non zero vev generates the masses of SM fermions.

The set of standard model elementary particles is divided into two subgroups: fermions and bosons.  The fermions consist of both charged and neutral leptons as well as fractionally charged quarks. There are three flavors of charged leptons $(\ell)$, the electron $(e)$, the muon $(\mu)$, and the tau $\tau)$. Each charged particle and pairing neutral neutrino $\nu_\ell$. The $e$ and $\mu$ are also generally considered as "light" leptons for there small mass relative to the $\tau$. The term lepton, depending on context, often refers to only the charged particles. As for the quarks, there are also three generations of pairs of quarks.. The lighest set of quarks are the up $(u)$ and down $(d)$ quarks, followed by the charm $(c)$ and strange $(s)$, and lastly the bottom $(b)$ and extremely massive top quark $(t)$.  The bosons are the force carrying particles which represent the gauge fields. They are comprised of the vector bosons - the photon $(\gamma)$, gluon $(g)$, the $W^\pm$, and the $Z^0$ - along with the singular scalar boson the Higgs $(h)$. The elementary pariticles are summarized in Figure \ref{fig:smfig}.

%The SM Lagrangian is composed of constituent sectors which describe diffrent groups/fields/particles. The main SM sectors are, the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) sector, the electroweak sector, the Higgs sector, and the Yukawa sector. QCD describes colored interactions of quarks mediated by gluons with the strong force. The electroweak sector unifies both the electromagnetic and weak interactions via exchange of W or Z bosons as well as electromagnetic interactions via $\gamma$. The Higgs sector introduces the complex scalar higgs field (citation needed). Interaction of bosons with the Higgs field causes the bosons to have mass and the Yukawa coupling describes the interaction of fermions with the higgs field which also allows the fermions to have mass (citation needed).



The SM is a asymmetric chiral theory, combining three groudps $SU(3)_L \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)$. The $L$, or left handed, subscript indicates that mirrored fields (with different chiralities)  transform differently under the Lorentz group and the EW gauge group (cite slides).  The consequence of chiralilty is that the possible combinations between interaction vertices is limited(cite thompson?). This peculiar property shows up with the $W$ boson, which only couples to left handed particles or right handed antiparticles. Extensions of the standard model also often include chiral properties.  %Helcity is the defined by the projection of a particles spin ontion its direction of motion (thompson). A particle is considred right-handed if the direction of its spin and motion is parallel. %It is left-handed if spin and motion antiparallel. (cite wikipedia helicity). This peculiar property shows up with the W boson, which only couples to left handed particles or right handed antiparticles.

\section{Supersymmetry}

Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an extension of the standard model. It adds a generator that rotates the spin between bosons and fermions. This then introduces a bosonic degree of freedom for every fermionic degree of freedom (cite run2 susy paper) which generates a super partner for each particle differiring in spin by a half integer.  The resulting set of mirrored elementary particles are referred to as sparticles. Each bosonic sparticle carries the same name as its fermion partner but with an "s" prefix e.g. sfermion, squark, selectron. As for the bosons, with the gauge fields $B$ and $\vec{W}$, these are accompanied by three super symmetric fields - the Higgsino $\tilde{H}$, Bino $\tilde{B}$, and Wino $\tilde{W}$. The B and $\vec{W}$ SM fields mix and yield mass eigenstates for $\gamma, Z, W^\pm$ while the Higgsino,Bino, and Wino mix to produce four neutral and two charged eignestates, the neutralinos ($\tilde{\chi}^0_1, \tilde{\chi}^0_2, \tilde{\chi}^0_3, \tilde{\chi}^0_4$)  and charginos ($\tilde{\chi}^\pm_1, \tilde{\chi}^\pm_2$). SUSY also requires an additional Higgs doublet to give mass to up-type and down-type fermions, (cite this) leading to five higgs boson states inlcuding two charged higgs and thre neutral Higgs. The lightest neutral higgs in the two higgs doublet represents the SM Higgs boson. The full set of SM and SUSY partilcles are featured in Figure \ref{smandsusyfig}. An additional higgs doublet also introduces a second vev. The ratio between the two vev's  is commonly denoted as $v_1/v_2 = \tan \beta$ and is an important parameter in experimental searches. We also introduce a new parameter similar to lepton number or baryon number conservation which is called R-parity. This parameter tallies the total number of SM particles (+1) and sparticles (-1) and expects the net total of particles to be conserved between initial and final states. R-parity conservation then requires sparticles to be produced in pairs. If R-parity is violated, the common consequence is that the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is unstable.

Supersymmetry is an extremely expansive model and intractable to experimentally test without significant well motivated simplifications. The most experimentally common simplified SUSY model is the Minimally Super Symmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The MSSM contains the smallest number of new particle states and new interactions which are consistent with phenomenology (cite howie direct weak scale book). The MSSM is still experimentally inaccesible due to the presence of over 100 parameters, meaning small differences in parameter space can completely morph the model structure and experimental signatures. To tackle the vast parameter space further simplification is needed, the most popular simplified model is the phenomological MSSM (pMSSM). The pMSSM contains 19 parameters which include the masses of each generation of squark and slepton, parameters to control the mixing of $\tilde{H}, \tilde{W}, \tilde{B}$, and dials for the higgs doublet.  The pMSSM is still borderline too complicated to attack directly, so the MSSM is boiled down into four parameters $M_1$,$M_2$, $\mu$, and $\tan\beta$ which are the gaugino mass parameters, the Higgsino mass parameter, and the vev ratio respectively (cite Fuks paper).  A model point from this four parameter space is referred to as Realistic simplified gaugino-higgsino model, these target specific and well motivated regions of MSSM phase space and experimental topologies.

To effectively grasp the structure of SUSY and various models either in the pMSSM or simplified models there are a couple key elements to condsider. The first being the mass scale of the relative susy sectors meaning how massive are the gauginos versus sleptons versus squarks. In an electroweak SUSY search with a simplified model the model is further simplified by assuming squarks are at the several TeV scale while the targeted electroweakinos are at detectable mass scale at the TeV and sub-TeV scale.  By decoupling sectors outside the sector-of-interest we remove the interaction between these groups, so, if sleptons are decoupled from the gauginos we avoid complicated dependencies between the two. The key element is the composition of the LSP, typically $\tilde{\chi}^0_1$, each unique model point yields a specific mixing of $\tilde{H},\tilde{W},\tilde{B}$ with an LSP that reflects that mixing. The model point is denoted by the field that dominates the overall mix, so a Higgsino model has an LSP composed of mostly $\tilde{H}$ (cite mixing altas paper?). The take away from simplified model types is that H,W,B  can characterize the nature of the model by governing the overall cross sections for sparticles, the topological infrastructure, and how these sparcticles specicially interact and decay amongst themselves and SM particles. Two pMSSM examples comparing the mass structure between two arbitrary mass points for a Wino model versus Higgsino model is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mass_modelpoint}. For both models the Higgs and slepton sectors are decoupled at a multi-TeV scale while the squark and gaugino sectors are at an accesible TeV and sub-TeV scale. Note that with small changes pMSSM model space results differing LSP content and large variations in the relative mass structure and orderings. The difference in cross sections between the same two model points for gaugino pair production combinations is showin in Figure \ref{fig:xsec_modelpoint}. This illustrates that the same tweak in parameter space can induce order of magnitude changes sparticle production.

Example of differing model points


In addition to the mass structure and cross sections the decay nature of H/W/B models also varies which has a significant impact on the experimental channels and signatures of interest. In an experimental search we would expect the lighter sparticles to decay to both SM particles along with the LSP, if the LSP is close in mass to the heavier sparticle of interest say O(100) GeV or less the model would be considered as a compressed scenario. Between the 3 types of models the most likely candidates for compression Higgsino-like and Bino-like models. The Wino type models by far have the largest cross sections but are the least likely to have compressed states. Particular interesting topologies involve decay signatures of processes like N2->ZstarN1, N2->C1N1, C1->W*N1, stop->tN1

%What particles are in susY?
%For each elementary standard model particle there is a super partner. For the quarks and leptons, the pairing is simple, there is just the equivalent slepton and squark partner. The gauge bosons are slightly more complicated, these are generally denoted with an "ino" suffix. There are also 3 super fields which mix in specific quantities to yield varying instances of particles with particular properties. These mixings define the characteristics of the model point by influecing things like decay mode, cross seection, and couplings.  (WhY?) There are four neutralinos $\chi^0_i$ and two charginos $\chi^\pm_j$. There are also 4 Hiigs bosons, a charged pair $H^\pm$ and a neutral pair $H^0_{u,d}$. (Why?)  The electroweakinos, i.e chargino or neutralinos, increase in mass with increasing index but the structure of reletavie masses depends specifically on the model. The $\chi^0_0$ is generally the lightest supersymmetric partilce (LSP) and in many popular models is stable. The instances of stable LSP depend on R-parity conservation. (Define R-parity conservation) If this is violated the LSP will decay into SM particles.



%Incldue a plot with mass hierarchies. Since there are so many possible parameters, varying sets of paramters can produce significant diffences in experimental signatures and topologies. Typically for a model we decouple specific sectors when generatting monte carlo, For instance if we are searching for sleptons, the squark or electroweakino sector will be chosen to be significantly heavier (out of current experimental range) effectively decoupling it from the slepton sector. Then from a simplified model with everything else decoupled we scan various topologies with particular mass values.
