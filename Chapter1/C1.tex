\section{The Standard Model}

The standard model (SM) is a collection of theories which explain the most fundamental particles as we know them. It is a gauge quantum field theory between SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) groups and uses a Lagrangian density to describe fundamental particles  dynamics and interactions. These particles fall into two separate categories, fermions and bosons both which can be divided into two subgroups. The fermions consist of leptons and quarks. There are three flavors of leptons, the electron $(e)$, the muon $(\mu)$, and the tau $\tau)$. For each flavor there is a charged particle and pairing neutral neutrino. The $e$ and $\mu$ are also generally considered as "light" leptons for there small mass relative to the $\tau$ and the term lepton, depending on context, often refers to only the charged particles. As for the quarks, there are three generations in mass in 3 pairs of quarks. The quarks have complementary fractional electric charges. The lighest set of quarks are the up $(u)$ and down $(d)$ quarks, followed by the charm $(c)$ and strange $(s)$, then the bottom $(b)$ and extremely massive top quark $(t)$. The elementary pariticles are summarized in Figure \ref{fig:smfig}.

The Lagrangian density composed of a sum of constituent lagrangian densities representing diffrent groups/fields/particles. The main SM sectors are, the quantum electrodynamic sector $\mathcal{L}_{QED}$, the quantum chromodynamics sector $\mathcal{L}_{QCD}$, the electroweak sector $\mathcal{L}_{EW}$, the Higgs sector $\mathcal{L}_{H}$, and the Yukawa sector $\mathcal{L}_{Yukawa}$.  QED explains the interactions of charged particles through photon exchange. QCD explains the strong interaction of quarks mediated by gluons. The electroweak sector unifies both the electromagnetic and weak interactions between all particles via exchange of W or Z bosons. 
The Higgs sector inculdes the higgs field, the interaction of bosons with this field causes the bosons to have mass. The Yukawa sector describes the interaction of fermions with the higgs field.

\section{Supersymmetry}

base super symmetery at lagrange level

Supersymmetry is an extension of the standard model. It includes an generator that acts as a rotation of the spin between bosons and fermions. This symmetry would generates super partners for each particle which differs by a half integer in spin. Thus there is a particle super partner (sparticle) matched to every particle and denoted with an "s" indicating superparnter e.g. sfermion, squark, selectron.
