\chapter{Compressed SUSY Search}

\begin{chapterabstract}
This chapter summarizes the approach for a compressed susy search and pertinent sensitive kinematic variables that the analysis is based on.
\end{chapterabstract}

\section{analysis overview}

A compressed system is defined by a sparticle such as a neutralino 2 or stop in which the mass difference with this particle and the lightest supersymmetrical particle is small. The mass difference is considered small when the sparticle decays to intermediate standard model particles like W,Z,t such that the intermediate particle is forced off shell. For example the smallest targeted mass splittings can range between 3 to 10 GeV in neutralino 2 to W/Z decays. The intermediate decays will be difficult to detect or separate from standard model backgrounds. To assist in identifying compressed topologies we look for ISR assisted events. The signature of the event then becomes an ISR jet back to back with sparticle system which consists of mostly missing transverse energy from the LSP and soft SM particles.


\section{ reference frames and kinematic variables}
An isr assisted event is divided into multiple reference frames. The CM frame consists of the particles measured in the lab e.g. the isr jet against the met system. The sparticle frame consists two subsystems A and B. THe sparticles are expected to be pair produced if r parity is conserved.

The kinematic variables the form basis of the search is RISR and MPERP.
Risr. RISR is process independent and peaks at the ratio of sparticle/lsp masses. mperp is the transverse mass of the sparticle frame with respect to the sparticle frame boost axis.  


\section{ signal models}
The analysis is generalized to deal with a broad range of signal models but the three targeted compressed signal processes incldue stop, neutralino/chargino, slepton production. the signals include T2tt, T2bW, TChiWZ, TChiWW, TSlepSlep
