\maketitle

\begin{abstractlong}

A generic search for supersymmetric particles with an emphasis on compressed scenarios is performed withproton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV and the CMS detector using a data sample with integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. Potential supersymmetric events with initial-state-radiation recoiling against a massive invisible sparticle system are organized based the Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction method. Events are then further categorized based on physics object combinatorics such as jet multiplicity, lepton multiplicity, b-tags, and kinematics that are sensitive to generic compressed sparticle topologies. This work focuses on a subset of many pieces of a larger analysis where the underlying compressed strategy is discussed, the selection of leptons and the calibration of simulation through the study of systematic effects, and the implementation and optimization of the data driven fit. Finally expected limits with a 95\% C.L. are placed on processes that include the production of electroweakinos, sleptons, and stops.

%%if you want a "quote" environment for acknowledgements,

First I would like to acknowledge the collaborative effort and work done by my research group. This work would not be possible without the extensive work of my advisors and peers which has been included alongside my own work for completeness. Much of the content is based on, or modeled after our internal Analysis Note \cite{AN}, so thanks to everyone that has contributed to this massive analysis.  
I am also extremely grateful for my supervisor, Professor Graham Wilson, for his invaluable mentorship and patience that has pushed me to be the best version of myself. I'm also grateful for everyone in my research group and their excellent advice and support, with a special thanks to the students which are always happy to team up and solve problems. I would be much worse off without the community we've developed. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to my parents which have been essential in helping me survive the final stretch of grad school.
