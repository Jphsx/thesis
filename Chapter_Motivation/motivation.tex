\section{Introduction}

The Standard Model is a remarkable theory describing a wide variety of sub-atomic phenomenon which also has consistently held up to tests over many orders of magnitude in energy. However, it's not a perfect theory. There are a few  experimental and theoretical problems that the SM can not yet explain such as: how to incorporate gravity,  how can we explain neutrino mass and mass orderings, or why is the universe made up of matter and not antimatter?  
A significant problem in physics, which connects both galactic scale and sub-atomic scale physics, is dark matter. Cold dark matter (CDM) is a type of matter that is thought to have played a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures in the Universe, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters \cite{Garrett:2010hd}. The evidence for CDM begins with observations of Zwicky in 1933 where he found that the observed motion of the galaxies in the Coma Cluster could not be explained by the gravitational interactions of visible matter in the cluster, but could be explained by adding additional invisible mass in the form of ``dark matter'' \cite{Zwicky:1933gu}. Additional evidence for CDM has compiled over the years such as: gravitational lensing data that disfavors being completely explained by effects black holes or condensed baryonic matter \cite{Massey:2007lens}, large scale structure formation where CDM can explain the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters \cite{Springel:2005}, and temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background that suggest the universe is composed of approximately 85\% dark matter \cite{Planck:2018vyg}. Despite overwhelming evidence for the existence of CDM there are no suitable SM dark matter candidates to explain the abundance of this potential cosmic particle. SUSY offers an attractive solution with the introduction of new particles that can explain dark matter directly via massive invisible particles, such as the neutralino, $\chi_1^0$, or sneutrino $\tilde{\nu}$. The neutralino can handle the CDM problem with models capable of producing the expected CDM relic density of the universe and, in fact, this is used to constrain SUSY model space and simplify searches. Aside from these leading motivations, other more detailed motivations will be discussed in this chapter, the first being the ``naturalness problem'' with its theoretically aesthetic improvement adding a symmetry to protect against divergent terms in the perturbative expansion of the Higgs mass. The next motivations are experimental, where SUSY offers an explanation to the significant deviation observed in the muon $(g-2)_\mu$ factor from recent FNAL result, as well as the deviation observed in the $W$ boson mass at CDF II. It should be noted that the divergent Higgs mass - known as the hierarchy problem - satisfies most SUSY scenarios up to the few TeV scale \cite{Barbieri:1987fn}, but, the two latter experimental measurements specifically motivate SUSY compressed scenarios.



\section{Stabilizing the Higgs mass}

An aesthetic attribute of theoretical models is naturalness. We should expect a model to function naturally if the ratio of free parameters in a model are of $O(1)$. Large swings between parameters would be considered fine-tuning and could indicate issues with the underlying theory. So, naturally, if fine-tuning exists in a model, it strongly motivates building extensions to the model to eliminate fine-tuning. %. We would expect with some improved theory with new physics one would balance out finely tuned parameters providing a natural solution to whatever is being modeled. 
One such fine tuning arises in the hierarchy problem, specifically in the Higgs self interaction terms. The SM Higgs Lagrangian terms that involve self interaction are illustrated in equation \ref{eq-higgslagrange}.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq-higgslagrange}
\mathcal{L}=\frac{gm_h}{4M_W}H^3 - \frac{g^2m_h^2}{32M_W^2}H^4
\end{equation}
$H$ represents the scalar Higgs field, $m_h$ the Higgs mass, and $m_W$ the W boson  mass. A correction to the Higgs mass can be calculated using standard perturbation theory by evaluating the second term of the Higgs Lagrangian \cite{Baer:2007izw}. 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:higgpert}
\begin{split}
\Delta m_h^2 = \langle H | \frac{g^2m_h^2}{32M_W^2} H^4 | H  \rangle = 12\frac{g^2m_h^2}{32M_W^2}\int \frac{d^4 k}{(2\pi)^2} \frac{i}{k^2 - m_h^2}\\
= 12\frac{g^2m_h^2}{32M_W^2} \frac{1}{16\pi^2}\big( \Lambda^2 - m_h^2\log\frac{\Lambda^2}{m_h^2} + O(\frac{1}{\Lambda^2})\big)
\end{split} 
\end{equation}
 
The equation \ref{eq:higgpert} integral term is the propagator for the exchange of a virtual Higgs and is integrated over phase space. The $\Lambda$ is known as the scale cutoff parameter and should be interpreted as the scale at which the SM breaks down, possibly near the Planck scale $O(10^{19})$ GeV. Notice the leading term $\Lambda^2$ indicates that the expansion is quadratically divergent. The divergent mass correction means there needs to be extremely large cancellations, around 20 orders of magnitude, to maintain $\Delta m_h \sim O(m_h)$. This divergent phenomenon can also be observed with fermion masses, but, chiral symmetry protects the fermion mass from divergence by canceling out high order $\Lambda$ terms. SUSY offers a similar protection to the Higgs mass by introducing a symmetry with the additional fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom leading to similar cancellations and producing a more natural model. 


\section{The Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment}

A major experimental motivation for SUSY lies within the measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment.  Multiple measurements between two labs, Brookhaven National Lab (BNL) and Fermi National Accelerator Lab (FNAL) have shown significant disagreement with the SM. These experiments measure the muon $g$ factor, or specifically, its deviation from two, $(g-2)_\mu$ .  The $g$ factor is related to the electromagnetic coupling of charged particles with the photon and largely depends on the tree level lepton-photon coupling, but, gets small quantum corrections from higher order loops. The largest correction is the single photon loop shown in Figure \ref{fig:gm2fig}. To predict the $g$ factor, an SM calculation is performed with three types of quantum corrections: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), Electroweak (EW), and Hadronic. Corrections from the Higgs are neglected because the effects are not experimentally observable. %the mass disparity $m_h >> m_{e,\mu}$ and the mass dependence in the Higgs coupling  effects that are smaller than what is experimentally observable. 
The g-factor prediction starts at exactly 2, with QED, and then involves quantum corrections up to $O(10^{-11})$. The prediction is compared with an experimental measurement at a very high level of precision. If the observation were to deviate from the SM prediction, it can indicate new and unaccounted for physics interactions with the SM leptons.
The current best $a_\mu = \frac{g-2}{2}$ prediction is reported as $a_\mu= a_\mu^{QED}+ a_\mu^{EW}+a_\mu^{\text{Hadronic}} =  116 591 810(43) \times 10^{-11}$ \cite{Muong-2:2021ojo}.
\FigOneScale{Motivation_figs/g2_diagrams_pdg.png}{Diagrams which contribute to $(g-2)_\mu$. Left is the single photon Schwinger loop that contributes the largest deviation from two. The middle diagrams are electroweak contributions and the far right diagram is the hadronic vacuum polarization the involves a loop with hadrons \cite{ParticleDataGroup:2020ssz} }{fig:gm2fig}{0.95}
 For each of the $a_\mu$ components, the QED component enters at the $O(10^{-3})$ and is known to $O(10^{-11})$. the EW component enters the sum at $O(10^{-9})$ and is known to $O(10^{-10})$. Finally the most complicated hadronic component, contributes at $O(10^{-8})$ and is known up to $O(10^{-9})$. The hadronic contributions arise from Hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) and light by light scattering (LBL) with the former diagram also illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:gm2fig}. The $a_\mu^{\text{Hadronic}}$ precision dominates the overall $a_\mu$ error and is constrained by data driven measurements alongside the limitations of the computational approach using QCD lattice theory. The BNL measurement of $a_\mu$ yields a difference with the SM prediction of $\Delta a_\mu := a_\mu^{BNL} - a_\mu^{SM} = 279(76) \times 10^{-11}$ which carries significance of $3.7\sigma$. The most recent $a_\mu$ measurement from FNAL confirms the BNL measurement within $1\sigma$ and the combined experimental average increases the SM deviation with a significance of $4.2\sigma$ \cite{Muong-2:2021ojo}.


%Experimentally the deviations from 2 are the most interesting, and are written in the form $a_\ell = \frac{g-2}/2$ and referred to as $(g-2)_\ell$. These small contribtutions are interesting because they encapsulate the current theory and provide a test bed for our current understanding.  If observations were to deviate from the SM prediction, it would be an indication of new and unaccounted physics interactions with the SM leptons. The $g$ factor can be extracted by measuring the anomalous magnetic moment of any generation of charged lepton.  The current best candidate to both test the SM and search for new physics is by measuring $(g-2)_\mu$ or $a_\mu$ because of  experimental precision potential. The electron measurement is already known to the highest precision and is expected to have the smallest contributions from new physics (cite youtube citation). The $(g-2)_\tau$ is not yet experimentally tractable competitive precision to $\mu$ or $e$.%so $(g-2)_\mu$ has been measured at both at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL) and again at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL).
%The current best SM prediction of $a_\mu$ from (CITE g-2 collab) includes QED, Electroweak(EW) and Hadronic contributions and is reported as $a_\mu^{SM} = a_\mu^{QED}+ a_\mu^{EW}+a_\mu^{\text{Hadronic}} = 116 591 810(43) \times 10^{-11}$. For each of the $a_\mu$ components, the QED compenent enters at the $O(10^{-3})$ and is known to $O(10^{-11})$. the EW component enters the sum at $O(10^{-9})$ and is known to $O(10^{-10})$. Finally the most complicated component, hadronic, contributes at $O(10^{-8})$ and is known up to $O(10^{-9})$, the  main sub components that contribute to the $a_\mu^{\text{Hadronic}}$ is the Hadronic vacuum polarization and light by light scattering, diagrams illustrated in Figure X. The hadronic precision is constrained by data driven measurements and computation approaches -- QCD lattice theory, this error dominates the overall uncertainty of $a_\mu$. The BNL measurement of $a_\mu$ yields a difference with the SM prediction of $\Delta a_\mu := a_\mu^{BNL} - a_\mu^{SM} = 279(76) \times 10^{-11}$ which is a significance of $3.7\sigma$. The most recent $a_\mu$ measurement from FNAL confirms the BNL measurement within $1\sigma$ and the combined experimental average increases the SM deviation with a significance of $4.2\sigma$.

%What could this deviation mean?
The $4.2\sigma$  is a compelling sign for new physics, but not a smoking gun. It is possible to reduced or eliminate the discrepancy by improving the calculations of the HVP and LBL contributions. New and updated calculations are being performed attempting to resolve the discrepancy by a few $\sigma$, but do not yet fully resolve the differences between observations and theory. If computational improvements can't bring the theory into focus, new particles would introduce  quantum corrections bringing experiment and theory into agreement. Several models qualify and successfully explain the $a_\mu$ SM deviation, one being SUSY, where for example, contributes additional diagrams via the smuon-muon coupling illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:gm2susy}.

\FigOneScale{Motivation_figs/g2_susy_loop.png}{Example muon diagrams which include sparticle loops that would contribute to $(g-2)_\mu$\cite{SvenTalkgm2}}{fig:gm2susy}{0.9}

%g-2 is an experiment designed to measure the anomolaus magnetic dipole moment of the muon. The spin magnetic moment of a charged, spin-1/2 particle that does not possess any internal structure (a Dirac particle) is given by (wiki direct quote \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-factor_(physics)}) ${\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mu }}=g{e \over 2m}\mathbf {S} }$. where g is the particles g-factor, $\mu$ is the magetic moment, $m$ is the particle mass and $S$ is the spin. The g-factor in quantum electrodynamics is close to 2 so typically the reported measurement is the difference from 2 or g-2 or as a signficance $a_\mu = g-2/2$. The difference from 2 arises from higher order contributions in quantum field theory

\section{The W boson mass}
%the most recent w mass measurement yielded a heavy W, this higher mass is more favorable for light higgsino and compressed susy models

%What is the W boson
The W boson is an important and peculiar particle, it is the electrically charged boson and couples only with left handed particles. The decay modes follow two channels: (1) the hadronic mode with different flavor quark pairs and (2) the leptonic mode with a charged lepton and neutrino. Measuring the W mass directly is challenging at the LHC due to either high levels of QCD di-jet background or missing energy from the neutrino. The mass parameter itself, $m_W$, underpins many important parameters in the SM as well. In fact, $m_W$ is related to the Higgs vev, implying that coupling of the Higgs field to all particles is effectively tuned by $m_W$. Similarly, $m_W$ is related to the $g$ factor from $(g-2)_\mu$, so, both $m_W$ and $g$ can be used to constrain new physics. The W mass can be parameterized at tree level in terms the fine structure constant $\alpha$, the Fermi constant $G_\mu$ and the Z-boson mass $m_Z$, with higher order radiative corrections coming from $\Delta r$ shown in equation \ref{eq:mwequation} \cite{Awramik:2003rn}.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mwequation}
m_W^2 = m_Z^2\Bigg(\frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} - \frac{\pi\alpha}{\sqrt{2}G_\mu m_{Z}^2 }(1+\Delta r) } \Bigg)
\end{equation}

%What is the current status of the W boson?
There is no exact SM prediction of the W mass, but, since there is an interdependence of many parameters such as $v$, $m_z$, $G_\mu$,$\alpha$ , the SM prediction is constrained by experimentally well measured parameters. The most recent measurement of $m_W$ was performed by CDF II at the Tevatron where $m_W$ was obtained by fitting the kinematic distributions of light leptonic decays recoiling against a system of jets. This measurement is $50\%$ more precise than the previous measurement by ATLAS and heavier than the SM prediction. The combination of a large deviation with very small error bars results in a significance of $7\sigma$ \cite{CDF:2022hxs}.  

%What could this deviation mean?
If follow up experiments confirm the excess in the W mass, it is a definite sign of new physics. The new physics would express itself as new particles in the radiative corrections via equation \ref{eq:mwequation}. Numerous SUSY models can explain the excessive mass of the W boson, but in general, a slightly heavier W favors light SUSY models, potentially at the electroweak scale, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:cdfw}. A light SUSY also implies light Higgsinos which favor compressed scenarios.  To illustrate the SUSY capability to satisfy both heavy $m_W$ and deviations in $(g-2)_\mu$, an abundance of model points are shown in Figure \ref{fig:gm2mw}.
% Due to the interdependence of $m_W$ and $(g-2)_\mu$, these parameters both constrain compressed SUSY and spotlight a critical area to search. An example of model points of sleptons and gaug-ino models which satisfy the newest $g-2$ and W mass constraints in shown in FIGURE Z (cite Wmass and g-2 sven paper)

\section{The current status of SUSY}
%drop the most recent limits here, start with multi TeV excluded gluino and squark models which leaves the a good place to search in the weak scale sector with electoweakinos. Talk about electroweak limits and how alot of these are excluded already one of the remaining places to search is the compressed corridor where mass splittings are small. link this limit motivation with how both g-2 and W mass favor compressed scenarios

There have been many searches for SUSY particles, starting from  LEP and still ongoing at the LHC. There is not yet observed evidence of SUSY, but, there also is not enough lack of observation to fully reject the SUSY hypothesis. The most comprehensively searched region SUSY space is related to strong production of SUSY particles. The large expected cross sections for squarks and gluinos compared to the inos or sleptons sectors offer the most low hanging fruit for potential discovery.
 %ut there is still plenty of room to keep searching. 
%The strong production of SUSY has the largest excluding limits due to the large expected cross sections compared to other sectors gauginos/sleptons.
Simplified model searches in ATLAS and CMS have excluded $\tilde{g}$ and $\tilde{q}$ (not including $\tilde{t}$) up to around 2 TeV with the most recent limits are shown in Figure \ref{fig:run2stronglim} and \ref{fig:run2squarklim} with their sister exclusions of stop squarks around 1 TeV shown in \ref{fig:stoplim}. The area inside the limit lines in each figure indicates that the 2-D mass points of the sparticle and LSP pair are ruled at a 95\% confidence level for the associated simplified model.
\FigTwoScale{Motivation_figs/gluinoPair_lim.png}{Motivation_figs/atlas_gluinopair_lim.png}{The CMS (left) and ATLAS (right) gluino limits from multiple competing channels and models \cite{cmslims}\cite{atlaslims}}{fig:run2stronglim}{0.48}{0.51}

\FigTwoScale{Motivation_figs/cms_stop_limit.png}{Motivation_figs/Atlas_stop_limit.png}{The CMS (top) and ATLAS (bottom) limits on stop production \cite{cmslims}\cite{atlaslims}}{fig:stoplim}{0.73}{0.85}

The CMS and ATLAS electroweak limits are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ewlims}. Note that the electroweak limits have sufficient data to only reach the TeV scale while SUSY remains valid at the few TeV. This leaves significant room in the 2-D mass plane to either discover or exclude SUSY by adding more data. One particular simplified model which is nearly unaddressed by both CMS and ATLAS is chargino pair production associated with final states with two oppositely charged $W$ bosons.  Most simplified models assume a mass degeneracy with $m_{\tilde{\chi}^0_2} = m_{\tilde{\chi}^\pm_1}$ but, there is no reason to believe that $\tilde{\chi}^0_2$ can not be decoupled from $\tilde{\chi}^\pm_1$. If this were the case, the limits would not apply in excluding charginos of any mass, So, it is important to address specific final state. The slepton limits  for both CMS and ATLAS are shown in Figure \ref{fig:sleplims}. These are generally the weakest limits of all the aforementioned processes, but, potentially the most important in association with $(g-2)_\mu$.



\FigTwoScale{Motivation_figs/c1n2_lim.png}{Motivation_figs/Atlas_chiwz_lim.png}{The mass limits on chargino pair production with degenerate masses $m_{\tilde{\chi}_2^0}= m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^\pm}$ for CMS (top) and ATLAS (bottom). There are no published limits on compressed chargino pairs in CMS  \cite{cmslims}\cite{atlaslims}}{fig:ewlims}{0.75}{0.8}

\FigTwoScale{Motivation_figs/slep_lim.png}{Motivation_figs/Atlas_slepton_lim.png}{The slepton mass limits for CMS (top) and ATLAS (bottom) which assume the same masses for L and R sleptons and combine smuon and selectron production \cite{cmslims}\cite{atlaslims}}{fig:sleplims}{0.8}{0.83}

For all of the previously presented limits from CMS and ATLAS, excluding gluinos and squarks, a common thread is that the weakest exclusion regions are the compressed regions. The compressed region varies from process to process. For example, compressed relative to stops is such that the mass difference $\Delta m = m_{NLSP} - m_{LSP}$ is less than the top mass $\Delta m < m_t$. Compression with eletroweakinos would have a $\Delta m$  below the W or Z pole. For sleptons decaying directly to leptons, there are no intermediate heavy particles like a W,Z or t, so, the compressed region is more ambiguous and is considered to be ``soft'' interpreted as $O(20-30)$ GeV or less. Several of the compressed scenarios, are unaddressed by CMS, but are complemented by dedicated compressed searches in ATLAS. However, each ATLAS summary result combines different searches with the common feature of large gaps between the results. So, based on the current status of all SUSY results, there is strong motivation to confirm compressed ATLAS results with a CMS compressed search but also extend the current limits and cover gaps between searches.
